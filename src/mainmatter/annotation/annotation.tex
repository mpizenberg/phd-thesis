Defining Image Annotation. \\ \\ 



A look at history:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Before digital images? Photogrammetry. Images were annotated to help human understanding, measurement
	\item Since digital images: machine learning then deep learning
\end{itemize}


Different types of problem that require annotation:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Image classification: scene (inside/outside : beach, mountain, forest, etc.) and main represented object (see MS COCO)
	\item Image captioning: describe an image with a set of sentences
	\item Object detection and localization : object class + bounding box
	\item Object segmentation : object pixel mask
	\item Image Segmentation. Semantic Segmentation / Image Parsing : classify all pixels in an image
	\item Human Pose annotation, shapes segmentation and similarity, etc.
\end{itemize}
All these annotations have been extended to video \\ \\

What applications to these problems? \\ \\

Different types of interactions for these annotations:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Free text typing
	\item Icon clicking
	\item points, lines
	\item bounding box
	\item polygon
	\item crcles, ellipses ??
\end{itemize}

Other important points:

\begin{itemize}
	\item implicit/explicit annotations
	\item Quality check of the annotations? Self-correcion system? Detection of bad annotations?
	\item expert or non-expert annotation ? Crowdsourcing ?
	\item QoE of the interaction staken into account?
\end{itemize}
