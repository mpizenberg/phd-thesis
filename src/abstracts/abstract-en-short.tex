Computer vision is the science of understanding the environment from images,
which is very useful in domains such as augmented reality or autonomous vehicles.
In this thesis, we explore how specific Web applications can help improving
some 2DÂ and 3D subfields of computer vision.

In the first part, we focus on the problem of annotation for image segmentation.
This task consists in identifying the pixels corresponding
to an object of interest in an image to help a computer to be able
to do it automatically later.
We present our method to efficiently annotate datasets of images
through an online crowdsourcing service.

In the second part of this thesis, we focus on the problem of visual odometry.
It consists in tracking the trajectory of a camera and reconstructing
a virtual 3D map of its environment just from the images provided by the camera itself.
We present our open source library, and a Web application able
to improve the algorithm results thanks to user input.
